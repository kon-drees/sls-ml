# Stochastic Local Search Algorithm with Heuristics based on Machine Learning


This Project implements the SLS WalkAAF algorithm and added Heuristics based on Machine Learning and other Heuristics.
This Code base was done for my Bachelor Thesis.

## Overview

This Python Project implements a Stochastic Local Search Algorithm with Heuristics based on Machine Learnig. 
The Machine Learning Models are trained with sklearn and PyTorch and used for the Heuristcs. There exist two models. One for finding the next Argument for switching its current Labelling and one for the initial Labelling of the Arguments in an Abstract Argumentation Framework
