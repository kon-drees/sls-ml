# Stochastic Local Search Algorithm with Heuristics based on Machine Learning


This Project implements the SLS WalkAAF algorithm and adds Heuristics based on Machine Learning and other Heuristics to find a single stable extension of an Abstract Argumentation Framework (SE-ST).
This Codebase was done for my [Bachelor's Thesis](https://github.com/kon-drees/sls-ml-thesis).




## Overview

This Python Project implements a Stochastic Local Search Algorithm with Heuristics based on Machine Learnig. 
The Machine Learning Models are trained with sklearn and PyTorch and used for the Heuristcs. There exist two models. One for finding the next Argument for switching its current Labelling and one for the initial Labelling of the Arguments in an Abstract Argumentation Framework





## Requirements

The [Light GBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation-Guide.html) classifier is installed.
Libraries under requirements.txt are installed.
